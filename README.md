# Predicting the torsion angle between VH and VL domains of the variable region of the antibody
\n
The torsion angle which was defined as part of Abhinadan and Martin's<sup>1</sup> paper, can be used to define the position of VH and VL regions relative to each other. This can then be integrated into structure predicting software to improve the accuracy of the biding region modeling.
